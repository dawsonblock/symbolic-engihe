# SIS v3.3.1 Architecture — Authority Closure

SIS v3.3.1 retains the v3.3 subsystems and closes the authority,
evaluation, identity, custody, ingestion and sandbox gaps that prevented
trustworthy promotion. It is a correctness/security release, not a new
learning algorithm.

## Trust boundaries

| Boundary | Owns | Never trusted from |
|---|---|---|
| Candidate database | candidate records, audit chain, materialized state | a local-only database as rollback evidence |
| Authority process | checkpoint signing key, publication sequence | candidate writers |
| Checkpoint store | append-only signed checkpoint chain | the candidate database principal |
| Evaluator | receipts, certificates, delivery attestations | optimizer-supplied candidate IDs |
| Harness adapter | execution identity | task text, repository names, tree digests in prompts |
| Evidence custody | immutable evidence, revocation/supersession | disappearance or mutable status columns |
| Serving gateway | scope/revocation/identity decisions | candidate text as authority |

## Modules added in v3.3.1

- `sis.v3.checkpoints` — external signed checkpoints, CAS publication,
  crash recovery, local-state verification.
- `sis.v3.evaluation_certificate` — `EvaluationCertificateV1`,
  `QualificationPolicy`, `QualificationValidator`, delivery attestations.
- `sis.v3.execution_identity` — `ExecutionIdentityV1` issuance and
  verification against the trusted repository registry.
- `sis.v3.evidence_custody` — content-addressed evidence, dependency
  links, signed revocation/supersession logs, offline policy.
- `sis.v3.skill_markdown` — bounded structured Markdown parsing.
- `sis.v3.evaluation_runtime` — pinned evaluator runtime, bootstrap
  probe, outcome taxonomy.
- `sis.v3.learning_qualification` — five-arm campaign analysis,
  McNemar/Newcombe statistics, real-agent gate.

## Serving flow

1. The harness adapter issues an `ExecutionIdentityV1` binding the
   requester, registry-resolved repository, commit/tree, workspace, task,
   family, harness and session nonce.
2. The gateway verifies the identity signature, expiry, nonce, repository
   tree/commit/family and any caller-supplied identity claims.
3. The gateway checks that the registry is certificate-policy qualified
   and checkpoint-verified.
4. `CandidateRegistry` folds the hash chain, verifies the state
   projection, re-authenticates decisions/evidence/certificates, checks
   custody status and compares the local state to the latest checkpoint.
5. Scope, applicability, counterexamples and revocation gates run per
   candidate. Candidate text is delivered only as advisory
   `helpful_next_checks`; it never grants authority.
6. Any integrity/identity/custody failure returns an abstention with no
   actionable candidate instructions.

## Qualification flow

1. A candidate is submitted at `proposed` by a learner role.
2. It moves to `evaluating` through role-gated, audited transitions.
3. The evaluator runs a sealed-holdout probe, signs per-task receipts and
   delivery attestations, then issues an `EvaluationCertificateV1`.
4. `QualificationValidator` re-derives signature, candidate identity,
   delivery, protocol, preregistration, sample size, conformance,
   statistics, negative transfer, revocation and scope checks.
5. An operator signs a `CandidateDecisionV1` for the exact
   `evaluating → qualified` edge.
6. `CandidateRegistry.qualify` stores the certificate, evidence and
   decision atomically, then the authority journal publishes a
   checkpoint.

## Production vs demonstration

`CandidateRegistry.qualification_mode` is `production` only when a
`QualificationPolicy` and validator are configured. A registry without a
certificate policy can hold demonstration/exploratory evidence, but
`GovernedServingGateway(production=True)` refuses it. This is deliberate:
the v3.3 demo campaign can still demonstrate machinery without claiming
production qualification.

## What is intentionally not claimed

- The local subprocess/seatbelt executor is defense-in-depth, not a
  validated OS security boundary. Production hostile-code evaluation
  requires a rootless worker or microVM.
- A five-arm scripted campaign is machinery evidence, not learning
  efficacy.
- The powered real-agent efficacy run is gated and marked blocked unless
  actually executed with an authenticated agent and hidden holdout.
