# SIS v3 implementation status

Current classification: **M0 contracts/policy plus SIS3-003 executor,
SIS3-005 episode store, SIS3-006 signed receipts, SIS3-004 CLI adapter (real
backend contact, quota-limited), SIS3-007–012 (procedure store + miner,
source-preserving patcher, hard-gated retrieval, recommend/abstain guidance,
signed promotion controller + rollback, external anchor chain, four-arm
benchmark harness) are implemented and locally tested.** A *passing* live
Codex episode is blocked by account quota (reset ~8:36 PM on run date);
OS-validated isolation, evaluator process separation, and any efficacy claim
remain unestablished. No v3.0.0-alpha label is claimed.

```

## Gate interpretation

The implementation and local tests are complete for the first two tickets, but
the overall M0 gate remains blocked on the planned archive identity. The pinned
Git source manifest and extracted Git baseline were independently checked in
this workspace; this does not substitute for verifying the absent ZIP hash.
No claim is made about live Codex capture, hostile-code containment, qualified
procedures, or improved coding-agent outcomes.
